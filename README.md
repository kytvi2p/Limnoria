If you have any trouble, feel free to swing by [#supybot and #limnoria](irc://irc.freenode.net/#supybot,#limnoria) on
[irc.freenode.net](irc://irc.freenode.net) or [#supybot](irc://irc.oftc.net/#supybot) at [irc.oftc.net](irc://irc.oftc.net) (we have a Limnoria there relaying,
so either network works) and ask questions.  We'll be happy to help
wherever we can.  And by all means, if you find anything hard to
understand or think you know of a better way to do something,
*please* post it on [issue tracker] so we can improve the bot!

# WINDOWS USERS:

The wizards (supybot-wizard, supybot-newplugin, and
supybot-adduser) are all installed to your Python directory's
\Scripts.  What that *probably* means is that you'll run them like
this: 

```
C:\Python27\python C:\Python27\Scripts\supybot-wizard
```

If you are running a Python version that is not 2.7, replace "27" in the
file names with your Python version, without the dot (for example "26".)

# DEVELOPERS:

We likewise have tons of developer documentation at
[supybot.aperio.fr] for your learning adventures.  Have fun :)
